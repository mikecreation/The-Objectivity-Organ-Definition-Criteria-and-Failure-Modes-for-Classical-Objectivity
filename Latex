\begin{abstract}
\noindent \textbf{Abstract.}
Classical objectivity is treated here as an operational phenomenon: stable, reproducible facts that multiple independent observers can infer without coordination and without significantly disturbing the system.
This paper rebuilds a unifying framework by treating decoherence, information broadcasting (Quantum Darwinism), thermodynamic stabilization, and renormalization as coordinated sub-functions of a single system-level mechanism.
We define an \emph{Objectivity Organ} as a composed mapping that takes a joint system--environment state and outputs: (i) a classical fact variable \(X\), (ii) a family of independently readable environment records \(\{\pi_k(X)\}\), and (iii) a scale-stable effective law class \(\Leff\).
To avoid known pitfalls in mutual-information witnesses, we define the broadcasting criterion using \emph{accessible information} and an SBS-compatible structure condition.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction and Scope}
Quantum theory describes microscopic systems as superposed and interfering, while macroscopic observations present stable outcomes and intersubjective agreement.
This work addresses a narrow question: \emph{under what physical conditions do stable shared facts emerge?}
We do not address outcome selection, subjective probability, or consciousness.
An observer is defined operationally as an agent with access to a local environment fragment \(F\subset E\) and a finite coarse-graining \(\mathcal{G}_\ell\).

The standard literature contains strong partial answers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Decoherence} suppresses observable interference \cite{Zurek2003}.
    \item \textbf{Quantum Darwinism (QD)} links objectivity to redundant environmental records \cite{Ollivier2004}.
    \item \textbf{Thermodynamics} constrains erasure and practical reversibility of records \cite{Landauer1961}.
    \item \textbf{Renormalization} explains why macroscopic laws are insensitive to microscopic detail \cite{Wilson1971}.
\end{itemize}

The novelty here is operational unification: these mechanisms are sub-functions of a single composed mapping that \emph{produces} classical objectivity.

\section{The Objectivity Organ: Definition}

\begin{conceptbox}[Organ Definition]
\textbf{An organ} is a composed physical mapping with identifiable sub-functions that produces a specific output class and has predictable failure modes when sub-functions are removed.
\end{conceptbox}

The Objectivity Organ is defined as a mapping on the joint system--environment state \(\rho_{SE}\):
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\Oorgan:\rho_{SE}\mapsto \Bigl(X,\ \{\pi_k(X)\}_{k=1}^N,\ \Leff\Bigr)
}
\end{equation}
where \(X\) is a classical fact variable, \(\pi_k(X)\) are independently readable records stored in environment fragments \(E_k\), and \(\Leff\) is a scale-stable effective law class governing coarse variables.

\section{The Four Functional Stages}

We decompose the organ into four functional layers:
\begin{equation}
\Oorgan := \mathcal{R} \circ \mathcal{T} \circ \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{strong}} \circ \mathcal{C}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Stage I: Decoherence (\(\mathcal{C}\))}
\textit{Role: Suppression of observable interference.}
When a system \(S\) interacts with an environment \(E\), phase information responsible for interference is redistributed.
Decoherence suppresses off-diagonal terms in a stable pointer description, rendering interference locally inaccessible and stabilizing \(\rho_S(t)\) \cite{Zurek2003}.

\subsection{Stage II: Strong Broadcasting (\(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{strong}}\))}
\textit{Role: Intersubjective agreement via redundant records.}
Objectivity requires that information about \(S\) be accessible to many observers via disjoint environment fragments \(E_k\).
To avoid false positives from discord-dominated correlations, we require a Strong-QD / SBS-compatible condition \cite{Le2019}:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{SE} \approx \sum_x p_x \dyad{x} \otimes \rho_{E_1}^{(x)} \otimes \dots \otimes \rho_{E_N}^{(x)},
\end{equation}
with fragment states \(\rho_{E_k}^{(x)}\) approximately distinguishable for different \(x\) by local measurements.

\subsection{Stage III: Thermodynamic Stabilization (\(\mathcal{T}\))}
\textit{Role: Facts persist because erasure is costly.}
Objectivity in practice requires record stability.
While correlating a system with a memory can be thermodynamically reversible in principle, resetting a record register is bounded by Landauer \cite{Landauer1961}.
Here \(\mathcal{T}\) is a resource constraint on feasible recovery maps rather than a dynamical channel.
For a fact encoded redundantly across \(m\) locally resettable records, a lower bound on full erasure under local reset and approximate conditional independence is:
\begin{equation}
Q_{\min}^{(\mathrm{erase})} \gtrsim m \cdot \kb T \ln 2 \cdot H(X).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Stage IV: Renormalization (\(\mathcal{R}\))}
\textit{Role: Robust classical laws.}
Observers describe systems through coarse-grained variables.
Renormalization theory formalizes how effective descriptions evolve with scale \cite{Wilson1971}, explaining the milling away of microscopic detail into stable macroscopic regularities captured by \(\Leff\).

\section{Success Criteria}

\subsection*{Unified Objectivity Condition}
Classical objectivity is present if and only if there exists a fact variable \(X\) for which redundancy, thermodynamic persistence, and scale stability hold simultaneously.
In practice, \(X\) can be taken as the pointer observable that maximizes redundancy \(R_\varepsilon(X)\) under the given environment partition.
All predicates are evaluated under finite local observer access and approximate fragment independence.

\begin{mathbox}[Unified Objectivity Condition]
\[
\exists\, X \;:\;
\begin{cases}
R_\varepsilon(X) \gg 1, \\[4pt]
Q_{\min}^{\mathrm{reset}}(X) \;\gtrsim\; m \kb T \ln 2 \cdot H(X), \\[4pt]
d\!\left(\mathcal{G}_\ell(\Leff),\ \mathcal{G}_{\ell'}(\Leff)\right)\le\delta
\quad \text{for } \ell<\ell'.
\end{cases}
\]
Equivalently, objectivity is generated by the composed mapping
\[
\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{R}\circ\mathcal{T}\circ\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{strong}}\circ\mathcal{C}.
\]
\end{mathbox}

These conditions are jointly necessary and jointly sufficient for operational classical objectivity under finite, local observer access.

\begin{mathbox}[1. Redundancy Predicate (Consensus)]
Accessible information \(\Iacc(X:F)\) denotes the maximum classical mutual information about \(X\) extractable from fragment \(F\) by local measurements (upper bounded by the Holevo quantity).
Define redundancy at tolerance \(\varepsilon\) by:
\[
R_\varepsilon(X) = \max \left\{ m \ \middle|\  \substack{\exists F_1\dots F_m \subset E \text{ disjoint} \\ \text{s.t. } \forall j:\ \Iacc(X:F_j) \ge (1-\varepsilon)H(X)} \right\}.
\]
Objectivity requires \(R_\varepsilon(X)\gg 1\).
\end{mathbox}

\begin{mathbox}[2. Irreversibility Predicate (Persistence)]
If \(m\) redundant locally resettable copies exist, a Landauer-type lower bound implies:
\[
Q_{\min}^{\mathrm{reset}}(X)\ \gtrsim\ m \kb T \ln 2 \cdot H(X),
\]
under local reset and approximate conditional independence of record registers.
\end{mathbox}

\begin{mathbox}[3. Scale-Stability Predicate (Lawhood)]
Let \(\mathcal{G}_\ell\) be coarse-graining at scale \(\ell\).
Law stability requires:
\[
d\!\left(\mathcal{G}_\ell(\Leff),\ \mathcal{G}_{\ell'}(\Leff)\right)\le \delta
\quad \text{for } \ell<\ell'.
\]
\end{mathbox}

\section{Failure Mode Analysis (Lesions)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discord-Dominated Correlations (Bad \(\mathcal{D}\)):} If \(\Iacc \ll I(S:E)\), apparent redundancy can be a false positive for naive QD witnesses \cite{Le2019}.
    \item \textbf{Asymmetric Encoding:} If information is deposited in channels atypical observers do not sample, consensus fails for typical observers \cite{Chisholm2022}.
    \item \textbf{Low Stabilization (Missing \(\mathcal{T}\)):} If record registers are not stabilized, facts are fragile and reversals are practically achievable (as seen in error-corrected quantum memory).
\end{itemize}

\section{Empirical Stress Tests and Anchors}
This framework does not introduce new microphysics. Its credibility depends on whether each sub-function is independently evidenced.

\subsection{Decoherence tested by interference loss}
Matter-wave interferometry with large molecules exhibits quantitative suppression of interference consistent with collisional decoherence theory \cite{Hornberger2003}.

\subsection{Redundancy tested in simulators}
Photonic experiments assess Darwinism signatures and investigate how multipartite correlations in the environment affect the emergence of redundant records \cite{Ciampini2018}.
Multi-photon quantum simulators quantify classical information proliferation and suppression of quantum correlations \cite{Chen2019}.

\subsection{Landauer bound tested in erasure}
Experiments verify approach to the Landauer bound in slow erasure cycles of a one-bit memory \cite{Berut2012}.

\section{Cross-Domain Structural Tests}
The Objectivity Pipeline is not restricted to quantum systems. It predicts consensus fails wherever any stage is absent.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Distributed computation:} Loss of global coherence arises from latency. Replication produces redundant state. Rollback is costly once logs proliferate.
    \item \textbf{Neuroscience:} Neural noise destroys microstate precision. Memories are redundantly encoded. Stabilization is energetically constrained.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The Objectivity Organ is a functional system, not merely a synthesis.
It takes a quantum substrate and produces classical, persistent, law-governed reality through a four-stage pipeline.
By replacing naive mutual information with accessible information and using an SBS-compatible structure condition, the framework becomes robust against common theoretical pitfalls.
The Objectivity Organ therefore specifies a minimal functional architecture that any physical system must satisfy in order to support stable, shared, and law-governed facts.
