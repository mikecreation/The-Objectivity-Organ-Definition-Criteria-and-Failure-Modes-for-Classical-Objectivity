**What it does:** Defines when a fact becomes *public and stable*.  
**Core idea:** Objectivity is an operational outcome produced by a composed mechanism: decoherence + strong broadcasting of accessible information + thermodynamic stabilization (erasure bounds) + scale stability under coarse-graining.
